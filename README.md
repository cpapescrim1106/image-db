# AI-Powered Image Catalog

An internal web application that allows users to upload images and catalog them using detailed metadata generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

## Features

- 🖼️ **Image Upload**: Support for JPG, JPEG, and PNG files
- 🤖 **AI Analysis**: Automatic metadata generation using GPT-4o Vision API
- 📊 **Rich Metadata Schema**: Comprehensive cataloging including style, composition, emotions, and usage recommendations  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database with image thumbnails
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Clean Streamlit-based UI
- 🐳 **Containerized**: Docker-ready for easy deployment
- ☁️ **CapRover Ready**: Configured for seamless CapRover deployment

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

### CapRover Deployment

1. Create a new app in CapRover
2. Set environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
3. Configure persistent directory: `/app/data`
4. Deploy from GitHub repository

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ with Streamlit
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Container**: Docker
- **Deployment**: CapRover

## Metadata Schema

The AI analyzes images and generates structured metadata including:
- Style identification and composition analysis
- Color palette with HEX codes
- Lighting and texture analysis
- Emotional tone and narrative interpretation
- AI generation prompts and recreation guidelines
- Recommended use cases

## Requirements

- OpenAI API key with GPT-4o access
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- CapRover (for cloud deployment)
